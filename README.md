I just really fear spending the short, short time we are given here on earth wallowing away in enterprise Java code, navigating the waters of reflection and java.security.KeyStoreExceptions. I'm afrad that will be my fate unless I purport some skills, advertized here. The basic minimalist, centered design idea originally came from my good friend and colleague Dan Frese. You can see his site at http://www.dfrese.me/.

I hope you have a really good day!
